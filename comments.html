			<p><span>Overall Design</span></p>
			<p>I think I had done an alright job when it comes to design. I used a really basic layout 
				and incorporated white space and a minimalistic colour scheme. I have kept the design 
				consistent across all pages and tried to add some personality where I feel it best fits. 
				With more time, this page could be a lot cooler but as for an assignment I got done in a week, 
				the design is pretty neat.
			</p><br>

			<p><span>Technical Aspects</span></p>
			<p>The site uses HTML and CSS alone along with Google fonts. In terms of the CSS selectors, 
				I‚Äôve used them to help style the HTML elements and make them conform to the design I want. 
				The selectors were just Simple Selectors, using the name, id and class.
				For the majority of the project, I have used class selectors since it was what I was used to using and was 
				more practical in this use case.
			</p>
			<p>The structure of the website mainly consists of a navbar, a header container that 
				remains consistent across all pages, a text container to hold all the content and a 
				simple footer. I decided on this structure since it was simple and easy to implement 
				and served the purpose of just displaying text in an aesthetic way as well as making it easy 
				to navigate/use. I was going for more of a blog layout and I am quite happy with how it has turned out.
			</p>
			<p>The command line was used to duplicate and copy over files as well as to make sure that the whole web 
				systems directory has the correct permissions.
			</p><br>

			<p><span>Aesthetics</span></p>
			<p>In terms of aesthetics, I was going for a design very much similar to my portfolio. 
				I thought it was simple and had a design that was well received (minimalistic and fun). 
				I included the use of emojis to add some personality to the page and make it more relatable. 
				People, myself included love emojis apparently.
			</p>
			<p>The image used in the header container is rounded since it‚Äôs a personal preference of mine 
				to have rounded images where ever possible. A square image would have been a bit distasteful 
				and jarring to the eyes. The image is a PNG and has some transparency, making it easier to 
				incorporate in the webpage.
			</p>
			<p>The background colour is an offwhite since a stark white background may have not been easy 
				on the eyes. An offwhite background is very common among professionally designed webpages since 
				it does give the page some depth and contrast.
			</p><br>

			<p><span>Concerning Accessibility</span></p>
			<p>How I‚Äôve tried to make the page accessible is by making the page easier to read with a large, 
				evenly spaced font. I have made the mode of navigation clear and easy by providing a nav bar 
				at the top of the page that is easy to see and consistent across all pages.
				I have not relied on the colour scheme and kept it minimal and easy to read with a lot of contrast (black and 
				white/ offwhite). The webpage operates in a predictable way and the design does not in any way cause seizures. 
				All functionality is also available through the keyboard.
