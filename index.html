			<p>Hi, I'm Hanisa.</p>
			<p>I spend most of my time overthinking trivial things and contemplating what my life would be 
				like if I were a Silicon Valley billionaire. 
				I’m a software enthusiast and self-proclaimed renaissance woman.</p>
			<p>I began seriously learning to code a little under 2 years ago. I have dabbled in HTML before then 
				but didn’t have enough skills to make anything substantial. In early 2019 I decided to teach myself 
				Python and get really good at it. About 2 months in, I was bit by the coding bug and fell in love with 
				programming. There’s something so satisfying about spending hours/weeks/months writing up some code and 
				seeing it all come together into something other people can use and enjoy. It really is quite awesome.
			</p>

			<p>I have a dating app on the AppStore that uses AI to verify and match users. 
				So far its got a handful of downloads and is hella buggy (needs to be reworked). I have also 
				contemplated getting into UI design since I find it so awesome. I feel like just a little bit of 
				good design skills can take all my projects to the NEXT level. That being said, I bought a course 
				and now I just gotta find time to learn 🥺.
			</p>

			<p>As of now, I’m just a Computer Science student at UTS. I work on a business on the side and spend 
				the rest of my time developing my skills technically, whether that be in iOS development, Android, 
				or data structures and algorithm knowledge. The plan is to graduate from uni with a job lined up and 
				my business still alive whilst maintaining some level of sanity.
			</p>

			<p>Things that inspire me:
					  <ul>
						  <li>My mother</li>
						  <li>The one plus smartphones</li>
						  <li>George Hotz</li>
						  <li>Anything well designed</li>
						  </ul>
			</p>

			<p>To whomever rates this webpage, I hope you let me pass or at the very least receive some 
				level of enjoyment from reading all my nonsense 😛.</p>
