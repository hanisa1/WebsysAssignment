			<h2 id="past">My Past 🕵🏾‍♀️</h2>
			<p>My past is not very conventional for some 20 something living in Sydney.</p>
			<p>In 2012, I got a scholarship to study in Hong Kong at an international school. I was looking for 
				schools that princesses go to and applied to the one that seemed most interesting. I ended up 
				receiving that scholarship funny enough and found out there were no princesses at that school.
			</p>

			<p>I didn’t end up graduating, unfortunately. I was struggling with my mental health and had to 
				stop schooling in my final year. It was quite a rough time for me and I still don’t know how I feel 
				about that time. All I can say is that I would not like to relive that time again (haha). 
			</p>

			<p>After coming back to Sydney, I decided I wanted to work full time and push Uni off to another date. 
				So I did that for roughly 2 years. Working full time was important for me because it made me realise 
				the importance of money and that I’m going to have to figure things out if I want to live a comfortable 
				life and afford to have a family one day. I got into the laser hair removal industry and worked as a 
				technician for a year after spending the year before that studying. I soon realised although I loved 
				the science behind laser hair removal, I HATED the industry. Around that time, I had an app idea and was 
				learning to code.
			</p>

			<p>I soon discovered my love for software and switched into Computer Science and am right here taking this 
				very subject. There are a lot of details I’m missing but this should about sum it up for you. 
			</p>


			<p>I’m still figuring things out and hope the next time I have to write about my past, I’ll have a few more 
				positive things to say!
