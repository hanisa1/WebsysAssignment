			<h2 id="future">My Future 💵</h2>
			<p>This is a tricky page to write. I can guarantee you tomorrow that my idea of what I want 
				for my future can take quite a turn. I know I will be in software, but it’s hard to say if 
				I even want to get a regular job or if I just want to throw everything out the window and 
				become some YouTuber celebrity who makes a crap tonne of money just talking about what makeup 
				I wear on a daily basis, but nonetheless, I shall share my master plan.
			</p>
			<p>Considering you guys know I have a business, Plan A is for that business to make enough money 
				so that I would have to get some lousy job. Preferably, I’d make enough money so that I could 
				live very comfortably. Although that is the dream, I still need a career to fall back on so, for 
				Plan B, I’ve listed the job positions that I’d be happy to take. I will not settle for anything 
				less as I believe I am of very high value 😌.
			</p>
		

			<p>Below is a list of positions I will be happy to negotiate, along with the minimum salary I 
				need to be offered.
			</p> <br>

			<table>
  				<tr>
    			<th>Company</th>
   				 <th>Position</th> 
    				<th>Salary</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Google</td>
					<td>CEO</td>
					<td>$2,000,000</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Facebook</td>
					<td>VP of Engineering</td>
					<td>$960,000</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Uber</td>
					<td>Cheif Machine Learning Officer</td>
					<td>$804,999</td>
				</tr>
			</table> <br>

			<p>To end this page, I’ll leave you with some lyrics that I think are very fitting.<br><br>

				💸💸💸 <br>
				Wanna be a baller, shot caller<br>
				Twenty-inch blades on the Impala<br>
				Call her, gettin' laid tonight<br>
				Swisha rolled tight, got sprayed by Ike<br>
				I hit the highway, making money the fly way<br>
				But there's got to be a better way!<br>
				A better way, better way, yeah<br>
 				💸💸💸
